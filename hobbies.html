    Once there was a princes, Nevaeh, destined to be ruler of a great land, she only needed to marry the right prince. At the age of 17 her father took her to the oracle to find out who was her husband to be. The oracle told them that she would marry a man who was quick witted, loving and strong willed; but that she could not marry until she was 19. Nevaeh hoped the oracle would be a little more detailed but asked no more of him for fear of being placed under a curse. On the eve of her 19th birthday princes from all around the world came to spend a share of time with her in hopes of winning her hand in marriage. The next day was a marvelous sight, there was a beautiful pink and white wedding and it seemed as though everyone from far and wide had sent gifts to the most beautiful bride Muloc had ever seen. The reception was an explosive event ending two days later with King Jacob and Queen Nevvaeh riding into the sunset. Months later Jacob and Nevaeh had a child named her Nicole and it seemed all was well but often times Nevaeh would sit on her marble balcony reflecting on her life and the things the oracle told her so long ago, tears streaming down her eyes. She had everything that most girls would only dream of but she wasnt happy so she ran away with her daughter back to her father's palace where she lived for the next two and a half years. In December prince Kobeer of Murdoce, one of her fatehrs close friends came to visit. He only stayed for a week but he and Nevaeh became very fond of each other, so when he left on his long journey back home she decided to leave with him. On her arrival to Murdoce she almost immediately wanted to return home. Kobeer, innocent as he seemed, only wanted her for her beauty and already had more concubines than he could count on three hands. Thus Nevaeh and Nicole left, sleeping just outside the walls of the city while she had her father send a carriage for her, he sent his most trusted servant. While she waited Nevaeh found that she was pregnant yet again, and her troubles had yet to be over. On her trip home she gave birth to her second daughter and named her April. Two cities from Muloc, just outside the town of Osira she was robbed and her fathers servant killed. The bandits took everything including the horses so she wsa forced to steal food from the marketplace for her and her daughter. A peasant by the name of Ecir noticed her and inquired about her situation. After she explained to him what happened he felt a deep compassion for her and offered to help. She accepted and four days later on the eve of Nicole's birthday they departed for Muloc. When they got there Nevaeh found that her father had died two weeks prior from a severe heart attack and that she was now queen to all of Muloc. She accepted but years later, on her 29th birthday, delegated the power to her cousin Isis so that she could marry Ecir and travel the world with him. And thats exactly what she did, her and Ecir were married in the palace courtesy of Isis. They bought a beautiful cottage just outside the castle walls where they lived happily ever after with Nicole, April, and their newborn son Gabria.
